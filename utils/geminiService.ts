        text: `You are an expert communication coach. Analyze the following speaker's speech and evaluate their speaking style based on the criteria below. **Provide both** a written evaluation **and** a **structured JSON** summary of your findings, including scores (1-10) for each sub-criterion.

**1. Voice & Sound Qualities:** Evaluate the speaker's vocal delivery, covering:  
- **Pitch/Tone:** (e.g. high, low, monotone, varied, singsong) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Volume:** (e.g. soft, loud, fluctuating, steady) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Tempo/Pace:** (e.g. fast, slow, variable) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Rhythm/Cadence:** (e.g. smooth, choppy, lyrical, staccato) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Clarity/Articulation:** (e.g. crisp, slurred, mumbled, precise) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Pausing/Hesitation:** (e.g. frequent pauses, filler words "uh/um", fluent flow) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Prosody (Intonation/Emotional coloring):** (e.g. expressive, flat) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  

For each of the above, comment on the speaker's performance and give a score from 1 (needs improvement) to 10 (excellent). If certain vocal qualities **cannot be determined from the provided input** (for instance, if you only have text transcript without audio), **note this limitation** in your comment.

**2. Word Choice & Vocabulary:** Examine the speaker's choice of words:  
- **Formality Level:** (formal, casual, slangy, technical) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Vocabulary Complexity:** (simple vs. complex words, jargon use) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Repetition of Words/Phrases:** (e.g. reusing phrases, catchphrases) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Directness and Clarity:** (straightforward vs. vague or roundabout) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Emotional Tone of Words:** (optimistic, critical, empathetic, neutral, etc.) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  

Provide observations on their word choice (e.g. Are they using simple language? Do they rely on filler phrases or jargon? Is the tone of their language positive or negative?) and score each sub-criterion.

**3. Sentence Structure & Narrative Style:** Analyze how they construct sentences and convey ideas:  
- **Sentence Length & Structure:** (short/concise vs. long/winding; proper grammar or run-ons/fragments) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Narrative Style:** (e.g. storytelling, explanatory, persuasive, descriptive) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Use of Questions:** (do they ask rhetorical questions, clarifying questions, etc.?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Use of Metaphors/Analogies:** (frequent, occasional, or none) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  

Comment on how the speaker's sentences flow and their overall style of narration or explanation, with scores for each aspect.

**4. Conversational Style:** Evaluate their interactive communication approach:  
- **Turn-Taking:** (do they interrupt or allow others to speak? if applicable) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Responsiveness/Relevance:** (stay on-topic vs. tangents, answer questions directly or evade) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Politeness & Etiquette:** (use of "please," "thank you," polite tone, hedging) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Assertiveness:** (confident and decisive vs. hesitant or deferential) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Humor/Playfulness:** (serious, witty, dry, sarcastic, etc.) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Form of Address:** (how they address others ‚Äì formally by title, casually by name, or using "you") ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  

Give feedback on how the speaker engages in a conversation or talk. If the speech is not interactive (e.g., a monologue), note the style in which they present themselves (formal vs. casual, humorous or serious, etc.).

**5. Non-verbal/Paralinguistic Cues (if observable):** Assess any non-verbal elements accompanying the speech (note: this requires video or detailed observation, otherwise mention that these cues are not available):  
- **Laughter/Chuckling:** (Did they laugh or chuckle? Was it appropriate?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Sighs/Breaths:** (Noticeable sighing or heavy breathing?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Gestures:** (Do they use hand gestures? Are they emphatic or minimal?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Facial Expressions:** (Are expressions aligned with the content? Smiling, frowning, etc.?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  

If a video is provided, describe these behaviors and how they affect the speech. If **no visual information** is provided, state that you **cannot evaluate this section**, and/or base it on any indirect cues from the audio if possible.

**6. Overall Impression:** Summarize the speaker's overall communication effectiveness:  
- **Warmth/Approachability:** (do they seem friendly and approachable?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Authority/Credibility:** (do they sound confident and credible?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Charisma/Engagement:** (are they engaging, charismatic, able to hold attention?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  
- **Consistency/Adaptability:** (do they maintain a consistent style? do they adapt their tone depending on context or topic?) ‚Äì *Score 1-10*  

Provide a brief **overall evaluation** describing the general impression the speaker gives. Highlight strengths (what they do well) and areas for improvement. If relevant, note whether they adapt their speaking style appropriately for the context or audience. Finally, give an **overall summary comment** about their speaking style and effectiveness (this can be a short paragraph).

**7. Filler Words and Repeated Phrases (Disfluency Analysis):**  
In a separate section of your response, analyze the speaker's use of filler words and any frequently repeated phrases:
  - List common **filler words** used (e.g., "um", "uh", "like", "you know") and **how many times** each occurred. If a transcript with timestamps is available, include **timestamps** for a few occurrences of each filler (e.g., when in the video they happen).  
  - Identify any **phrases or sentences** the speaker tends to repeat (e.g., a catchphrase or a repeated transition like "So, basically..."). Provide examples of these repeated phrases and their **timestamps** or approximate positions in the speech.

If no transcript timestamps are available, you can indicate the frequency (count) and relative position (e.g., "frequently throughout the talk" or "mostly at the beginning") instead of exact times.

**Output Format Instructions:**  
- Your primary output should be a single, well-structured JSON object containing the entire evaluation. This JSON should be the first thing you output.
- The JSON object must include all categories (1-6) and their sub-criteria, each with a "score" (1-10) and a brief "comment".
- Include the "Disfluency Analysis" (category 7) within the JSON, detailing filler words and repeated phrases with counts and timestamps if available.
- After the JSON object, provide a brief, high-level **written summary** (2-3 paragraphs) of the speaker's key strengths and most critical areas for improvement. Do not repeat all the details from the JSON.
- Ensure the JSON is valid and can be parsed by a program.

Make the tone of your evaluation **constructive and objective**. Be sure to **praise** the speaker's strengths and **gently point out** areas that could be improved, using an encouraging tone. If some criteria cannot be evaluated due to lack of data (e.g., no audio for voice pitch, or no video for gestures), clearly state that those aspects are **not determinable from the given input**.

Now, proceed with the evaluation based on the provided material.
